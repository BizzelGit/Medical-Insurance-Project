After the loop, create a variable called average_cost that stores the total_cost divided by the length of the medical_costs dictionary.

Print average_cost with the following message:

Average Insurance Cost: {average_cost}

______

total_cost = 0

for key, value in medical_costs.items():
    total_cost = total_cost + value
    print(f"Der Wert von {key} ist {value}")

average_cost = total_cost / len(medical_costs)     

print(f"der Gesamtwert aller Kosten bel√§uft sich auf {total_cost}")
print(f"Average Insurance Cost: {average_cost}")
