        med_sex = medical_records[key]['Sex']
        med_smoker = medical_records[key]['Smoker']
        med_bmi = medical_records[key]['BMI']
        med_insurance = medical_records[key]['Insurance_cost']
    print(f"{name} is a {med_age} year old {med_sex} {med_smoker} with a BMI of {med_bmi} and insurance cost of {med_insurance}")
